# Furry Game - JavaScript
My project "Furry Game - JavaScript" was created during Coders Lab course. I used HTML, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, Ajax, Json Server, Webpack.
This is third step in my portfolio. I started learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript a few months ago and now I can make game as you can see.

## Used technologies
In my project I made use of, among other things:

HTML:
+ tags: header, section, footer, div, button
+ attributes: id, class, href, alt, src

CSS:
+ display: flex
+ pseudoclass: :hover,
+ background: image, size, reapet
+ z-index
+ border-radius
+ box-shadow
+ text-decoration

JavaScript:
+ searching DOM Elements by querySelector
+ addEventListener: "click"
+ loops: forEach
+ adding classes, innerTexts
+ constructors
+ functions
+ if else
+ switch
+ setInterval(), clearInterval()
+ sort()
+ Json Server
+ Ajax

and many more.

## Usage
To start using this game, just download whole content, then in console/terminal run npm install, afterwards go to "db" directory and run: 

json-server --watch furry.json
 
to connect to the server and at the end run index.html file or simply click here: http://kubikweb.usermd.net/FurryGame/

Enjoy! Try to beat the best score ;)
 
 ## Game rules
 Furry gets bitcoins. He wants to have them as much as possible. To pleasure Furry you have to try be the best. The heighest score is 
 saved on server. 
 Game Over is when:
 + Furry goes out of the board,
 + time is out. 
 
1 bitcoin = 1 point

Good luck! Be the best!
